java script is a Synchronous and sungle thread by default.


block code(Synchronous) vs non-block code(Async)
//block code ex(single thread) - if i want to register the user id in Database then fist step is get successfull register then we have to notifify to the user. 
//non-block code ex(async thread) - 2 process are working constantly parallel. there is no dependency is knwn as the asynchronous.


2 things are there in WEB API 
...
set timeout(func(){},5000); // this means to run after the 5 sec mentioned in the syntax;
...
set Interval(func(){}, 1000); // this method is telling that to run in every specific time mentiooned in the syntax;

set timout will push the function inside the REgister CAll back then if runs it will add into queue then stack.
