// In this we will Study About the For loops

const arr = ["flash" , "batman" , "ironman"]

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const element = arr[i];
    console.log(`Heros: ${element}`);
}

// 3 Keywords are also performed such as Break , Continue , Pass

// Break ->(The break statement "jumps out" of a loop) Break Keyword do stop all the iteration after the condition then we will out from the Loop
// Continue -> In this keyword accept the condition given all the iteration will work. 
// Pass -> It is used like is we forget something the execution process throw an error so it didnt throw after the pass keyword.
